I had used this repo ( https://github.com/W0rthlessS0ul/HackRF-Portapack-WAV-Creator ) to generate my wav files, it works! 
The bmps i just googled a jpg to bmp generator and made sure the dimenions matched the portapack specifications.
I will upload more as i go through and filter out what i wanna keep myself.
